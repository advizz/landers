                <p>During her decades of marriage, Ashley Davis&#39; skin has deteriorated severely due to constant
                    stress, irregular use of sunscreen, occasional wine, and a few cigarettes.</p>

                <p>When she overheard her husband of 43 years refer to her as a <strong>&ldquo;wrinkled old
                    prune&rdquo; </strong> the Melbourne native, now 67, decided to embark on a wrinkle transformation
                    journey to feel young in her body again &mdash; and has wiped an impressive 32 years off her face!
                </p>

                <p>Read on to discover how Ashley Davis successfully restored decades of youth to her face and got
                    revenge on her ex-husband using Dr. Oz&#39;s groundbreaking tip.</p>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="Files/comp1.png"/>
                <h5 class="text-center"><i>After her husband DIVORCED her because she was &ldquo;TOO OLD&rdquo; Ashley
                    Davis promised to get revenge by getting the youngest, most beautiful face she has had in over 20
                    years. She considered cosmetic surgery but due to being evaluated as a &ldquo;high risk patient&rdquo;
                    by her doctor she couldn&rsquo;t proceed. <strong>Then what she heard on The Ellen Show changed her
                        life.</strong></i></h5>

                <p></p>

                <p>&quot;My skin was tight and pretty when I was younger, and I never had any wrinkle problems. I
                    graduated college without a single wrinkle on my face. When I went to work at a local corporate
                    office, <strong>I developed some bad habits</strong> like not putting on sun screen daily, drinking
                    alcohol, and occasionally even smoking.</p>

                <p>As the decades passed me by, my face shriveled up. The wrinkles snuck up on me. I was <strong>miserable
                    and embarrassed</strong>... When I went out with friends, I found myself constantly feeling insecure
                    and running to the bathroom to put on more makeup. I did not like seeing my own reflection and
                    started avoiding close-up mirrors.</p>

                <p>One day, I overheard my husband refer to me as a <strong>&ldquo;wrinkled old prune.&rdquo;</strong>
                    When I confronted him, he went as far as boldly telling me <strong>&ldquo;I CHEATED on you because
                        you&rsquo;re too old!&rdquo;</strong> and then he divorced me! This was a painful, humiliating
                    shock. Until that point, no one had ever addressed the fact that my face had gotten so wrinkled and
                    old and I had been in denial.</p>

                <p>Today, I am thankful for that comment because it motivated me. I knew I needed to get my face and
                    skin healthy for me, and me alone. Had I not changed my lifestyle, I am certain I was on my way to
                    looking like an old, dried-up prune. I took a long, painful look in the mirror and knew <strong>I
                        had to do something fast!</strong>&quot;</p>

                <p>Ashley tried one method after another with little or no results. She even considered plastic surgery
                    but was hesitant to go under the knife. Thing were looking hopeless until a few weeks ago while
                    watching The Ellen Show, <strong> Ashley listened to Diane Keaton EXPOSE Dr. Oz&#39;s skincare
                        secret. </strong> <img class="img-responsive" src="Files/comp2.png"/></p>

                <p>He has reserved this secret technique only for celebrity clients who want to look 10 to 15 years
                    younger fast, but are scared of the potential risks of surgery or botox.</p>

                <p>When Ashley found out about it, she was so surprised by how shockingly simple, cheap, and effective
                    this technique was, that she had to test it herself.</p>

                <p>Here at &#39;Shape&#39; we have been receiving <strong>so many wrinkle transformation
                    submissions</strong> from our readers that we decided to write a feature article reporting on Ashley&#39;s
                    results! Read on...</p>

                <p>Dr Oz had always kept this wrinkle secret reserved for his high paying celebrity clients...until

                    cheap!&quot; </strong> </i></h5>

                <p>Diane Keaton said she felt that it was her duty to let her fans know. She was tired of hearing
                    countless stories of her viewers losing $3000&#39;s on expensive anti aging products, or dangerous
                    plastic surgeries. As a result, a few weeks ago <strong>she exposed the simple solution Dr Oz had
                        previously only shared with his celeb clients...to everyone watching The Ellen Show!</strong>
                </p>

                <p>Dr. Oz&#39;s big skincare secret is that after months and months of pain staking tests and research,
                    his team discovered 2 products that when combined <strong> literally took 10 to 20 years off women&rsquo;s
                        appearance in just a month. The shocking part is that they are 100% safe, and cost next to

                            href="#offerbox"><span>Abella Mayfair Day &amp; Night Cream</span></a>.</p>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="Files/rf.jpg"/>
                <h5 class="text-center"><i>&quot;This is the anti aging miracle of the decade as far as I&#39;m
                    concerned.&quot; </i></h5>

                <h4>So what is it?</h4>

                <h4>2 Key Ingredients For Anti Aging:</h4>

                <p><strong>1. Matrixyl 3000+ Complex<br/>
                    2. Argireline</strong></p>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="Files/before_after.jpg"/>

                <p class="m-t-25">These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase wrinkles and fine lines
                    at the cellular level &ndash; below the surface of the skin &ndash; which is why they&rsquo;re so
                    effective.</p>

                <p><strong>Matrixyl 3000+ Complex, The Fountain of Youth:</strong><br/>
                    The first piece of the anti aging puzzle <strong>Dr. Oz</strong> talked about was <strong>Matrixyl
                        3000+ Complex</strong>.</p>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="Files/ozskin.jpg"/>
                <h5 class="text-center"><i>&quot;Matrixyl 3000+ Complex is the secret to cheat your age&quot;. -Dr.
                    Oz </i></h5>

                <p>Matrixyl 3000+ Complex penetrates deep into damaged skin and stimulates new collagen &ndash; a
                    protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. It&#39;s all the rage in beauty circles, much in
                    part because of a 2009 study stating, applying non-prescription Matrixyl 3000+ Complex to your skin
                    caused a <strong>60% reduction in fine lines and wrinkles</strong>. Dr. Oz said this is why <a
                            href="#offerbox"><span>Abella Mayfair 90 Second Rapid Wrinkle Control</span></a> is so
                    effective. It was one of the few products on the market that had Matrixyl 3000+ Complex in the right
                    consistency and dosage.</p>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="Files/test1.jpg"/>

                <p class="m-t-25"><strong>Argireline:</strong><br/>
                    He said the second piece, when combined properly with Matrixyl 3000+ Complex, literally makes your
                    face <strong> look two decades younger in weeks! </strong> Argireline works by binding to moisture.
                    It can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper.
                    Argireline helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from dryness, environmental
                    stresses, or irritation. He said one of, if not the only products you can buy over the counter with
                    an effective concentration of Argireline was found in <a href="#offerbox"><span>Abella Mayfair Day &amp; Night Cream</span></a>.
                </p>
                <img class="img-responsive m-b-30" src="Files/test2.jpg"/>

                <p class="small-text">&quot;What the combination of <strong>Matrixyl 3000+ Complex &amp;
                    Argireline</strong> does is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and helps your skin generate
                    fresh, younger layers. Our tests show that you can erase almost 10 to 20 years off your face in less
                    than 14 days. But the key is to choose the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest
                    quality ingredients, since they&rsquo;re not all the same. The only two we found during our research
                    were <a href="#offerbox"><span>Abella Mayfair 90 Second Rapid Wrinkle Control</span></a> with <a
                            href="#offerbox"><span>Abella Mayfair Day &amp; Night Cream</span></a>. This is what my wife
                    uses. This is what I recommend to all my celebrity clients.&quot; - Dr. Oz</p>

                <h4>&quot;How do I use it?&quot;</h4>

                <p>It&#39;s actually very simple. You simply use both products before bed. Dr. Oz said on the show that,
                    &quot;The trick is to combine <a href="#offerbox"><span>Abella Mayfair 90 Second Rapid Wrinkle Control</span></a>
                    with <a href="#offerbox"><span>Abella Mayfair Day &amp; Night Cream</span></a>. These two products
                    both contain high concentrations of pure Matrixyl 3000+ Complex and Argireline in just the right
                    concentrations. My team also discovered that they contain all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient
                    called Dermaxyl <strong> (also known as facelift in a jar) </strong> and Ester-C (the active
                    anti-aging compound in Matrixyl 3000+ Complex).</p>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="Files/gfds.jpg"/>
                <h5 class="text-center"><i>&quot;Getting older is rough for any woman, even an actress. Now I feel like
                    a new woman! Thanks Dr. OZ!&quot; </i></h5>

                <h4>We Decided to Put it to the Test!</h4>

                <p>As excited as we were after the show and the flood of emails and letters, we wanted to research Dr Oz&#39;s
                    anti-aging ingredients ourselves before we wrote this feature piece praising them. We decided to
                    take one volunteer from our readers. You&#39;ve already met Ashley Davis, who jumped at the chance
                    to trial this combo. Here are her results...</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Ashley&#39;s 14 Days Abella Mayfair 90 Second Rapid Wrinkle Control and Abella
                    Mayfair Day &amp; Night Cream Trial Results:</h3>

                <p>Ashley is a 67 year grandma of 2 from Los Angeles. Like most women her age, the years have started to
                    give her unwanted lines and wrinkles. Ashley said she decided to trial Abella Mayfair 90 Second
                    Rapid Wrinkle Control and Abella Mayfair Day &amp; Night Cream because she was so frustrated that
                    nothing else has produced results. She was even considered a highly risky and very expensive
                    facelift procedure. Cellumis was somewhat of a last resort for her.</p>

                                    was astonished by the results, and literally felt 15 years younger again. It was
                                    like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off!</p>

                                <p>I don&#39;t know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling sensation on
                                    my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in the mirror and saw that
                                    my face looked a bit rosy - the result of revitalizing blood rushing to the surface
                                    of my skin to renew my face.</p>

                                <p>After both products were absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a
                                    beautiful glow to it.&quot;</p>

                                <p>&quot;After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and scepticism absolutely vanished -
                                    SO DID MY WRINKLES!</p>

                                <p>The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows&rsquo;
                                    feet &ndash; even the age spots on my face had COMPLETELY disappeared. I&#39;ve
                                    never felt or seen anything tighten my skin with this kind of force before, no
                                    matter how expensive the product!</p>

                                <p>After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that way, it actually improved every day
                                    until it became as beautiful and radiant as it was 20 years ago. <strong>By this
                                        point, all my friends and family were shocked. They couldn&#39;t believe the
                                        difference, and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox - I CAN&#39;T
                                        WAIT to show them this article!&quot;</strong></p>

                <p>&quot;Eventually <strong> the word of my youthful transformation got to my ex-husband </strong> who
                    had divorced me for being &quot;too old&quot;. He came crawling back and asking to take me out to
                    dinner at one of the fanciest restaurants in town - the very same restaurant he used to take me to
                    when were were dating decades ago. He told me that he had &quot;made a huge mistake&quot; and that
                    he had realized that he &quot;can&#39;t live without me&quot;. He called, texted, and emailed me day
                    and night.</p>

                <p>Eventually I had to change my phone number and email address. Finally one day, he got the nerve to
                    come straight to my house to try to convince me to give him a chance! This is what I had been
                    waiting for. I had gone over this conversation in my mind a thousand times and told him exactly how
                    I felt, <strong> &quot;I&#39;m glad that you divorced me and I&#39;ll NEVER take you back - you&#39;re
                        just too old and boring for me now.&quot; </strong> The look on his face was priceless!&quot;

                        href="#offerbox"><span>Abella Mayfair Day &amp; Night Cream</span></a>, removed virtually 90% of

                        <p>I have been using this Anti Aging trial for 3 weeks now, and I seriously look 5 years
                            younger! Not quite as good as this mom, but I will take it when it was less than 5 bucks for
                            each! My crow&#39;s feet and laugh lines are melting away more and more every day. Thank you
                            so much for reporting on this!</p>

                        <p>I saw this combo on CNN a while ago and still using the combo. I&#39;ve been using the
                            products for about 6 wks (Abella Mayfair 90 Second Rapid Wrinkle Control came first, had to
                            wait for Abella Mayfair Day &amp; Night Cream for an extra day). Honestly, this is
                            unbelievable, all I have to say is WOW.</p>

                        <p>A friend of mine used and recommended it to me 3 weeks ago. I ordered the products and
                            received them within 3 days (although I didn&#39;t get the discounted prices). The results
                            have been incredible and I can&#39;t wait to see what weeks 3 and 4 bring.</p>

                        <p>My sister did this a few months ago, I waited to order my trials to see if it really worked
                            and then they stopped giving out the trials! what a dumb move that turned out to be. glad to
                            see the trials are back again, I wont make the same mistake.</p>

                        <p>Yes this stuff is amazing! My best friend Gina uses this, I&#39;ve been trying for years to
                            get rid of my wrinkles and nothing was helping. You alerted me to the possibility of
                            achieving my goals, which is looking great for my daughter&#39;s wedding. I just ordered the
                            free trials of the skin creams and I have a very good feeling about them!!</p>

                        <p>I tried the wrinkle cream thing a while ago and it worked pretty good but I didn&#39;t know
                            about step two. I&#39;ll give it a try and let you know.</p>
